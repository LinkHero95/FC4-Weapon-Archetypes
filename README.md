##	Disclaimer and Permissions
- This is a mod in progress, and in no way finished. Usage of this mod may cause game to crash.

##	Overview
<p>This repository contains the data regarding converted XML files for FCB files regarding weapon files, weapon properties files, and weapon files.</p>
<p>The objective of this project is to create a different set of base weapon files for Far Cry 4. These files will be identical to the vanilla files in all respects but one: Picking up weapons dropped by deceased NPCs does not unlock them in the shop. They can still be used, but no attachments or paint schemes can be applied to them. In addition, picking up weapons from random locations where they are present also does not unlock them in the shop.</p>
<p>This is not a new feature in the history of Far Cry modding: it was done by Ziggy in his famous Far Cry 3 mod. Since the Far Cry 4 engine is an extension of its Far Cry 3 counterpart, a similar mechanism will work here.</p>
<p>The ultimate aim of this project is to make two different versions of every weapon in the game: one to be used by the player, and the other to be used by NPCs. This will allow NPCs to use any weapon without depriving the player of the opportunity to buy these weapons in the shop.</p>
<p>Once this project is complete, different versions of these files can be generated; for example, a version with auto-reload disabled for all weapons, changing tha ammunition used by weapons, etc.</p>

##	Requirements to Edit
1. A working copy of Far Cry 4 for testing purposes. Every change that you make will need to be tested.
2. Git, found [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Git is used as a source control file system, to keep track of all changes, and to revert back any unwanted changes.
3. Dunia Tools, found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/farcryprimal/mods/5). These tools are used to pack and unpack the XML files which we will use.
4. A good text editor. I recommend *Notepad++*, found [here](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/). This tool has a variety of advantages over the default editor, primarily the ability to undo (and redo) multiple changes at once. If you are used to something else, feel free to use your preferred editor instead.
