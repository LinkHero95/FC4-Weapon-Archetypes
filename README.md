##	Overview
This repository contains the data regarding converted XML files for FCB files regarding weapon files, weapon properties files, and weapon files.

##	Requirements to Edit
1. A working copy of Far Cry 4 for testing purposes. Every change that you make will need to be tested.
2. Git, found [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Git is used as a source control file system, to keep track of all changes, and to revert back any unwanted changes.
3. Dunia Tools, found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/farcryprimal/mods/5). These tools are used to pack and unpack the XML files which we will use.
4. A good text editor. I recommend *Notepad++*, found [here](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/). This tool has a variety of advantages over the default editor, primarily the ability to undo (and redo) multiple changes at once. If you are used to something else, feel free to use your preferred editor instead.
