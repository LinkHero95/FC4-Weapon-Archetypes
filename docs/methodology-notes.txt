I cannot change placed weapon pickups that easily.
I can change enemy weapon pickups easily.
I can create my own archetype files.

So I create my own pickups, which point to default weapons and vice versa. 
default pickups point to npc weapons and vice versa.

Steps:
Create 6 xmls

change names and hashes as required
	wpn xml changes
		lines 3,4,5,6,7,9,14,15, text_hidName,hidName, wpnpropsWeaponProperties
		
	props xml changes:
		lines 3,4,5,6,7,9,14,15,20,79

	pkp xml changes
		lines 3,4,5,6,7,9,14,15,43

check the 2 loops
wpn -> wpnpropsWeaponProperties -> props -> 79 -> pkp -> 43 -> wpn

check the attachment slots in props (line 1151)

create entries in object inventory.xml
	id
	path
	path hash
	ark name as name.
